ERROR:
Vblank handler is being run when IME==0
The Vblank handler calls procedures which check against High RAM
Eventually, the Vblank handler calls a memory location in High RAM.
This is not initialized by this time, causing garbage data to be executed.

Solution:
PPU mode event needs to be paused when LCD is off.
	(though this doesn't seem to be causing this particular problem).
CPU needs to respect IME and not interrupt when IME==0.
